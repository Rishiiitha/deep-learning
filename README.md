## What is Neural Network:
    A neural network is a machine learning model, a core component of deep learning, that mimics the structure of the human brain to learn complex patterns in data. It consists of interconnected neurons (nodes) arranged in layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. By adjusting the strength of the connections between neurons (weights) through a process called training, the network learns to make predictions or classifications, enabling tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

## What is ANN:
    NN, or Artificial Neural Network, is a type of deep learning algorithm that mimics the structure and function of biological neural networks, like the human brain, to process data and learn from it. These interconnected mathematical systems of "neurons" are organized in layers and use weighted connections and activation functions to process inputs, make decisions, and produce outputs, enabling machines to perform tasks like classification, pattern recognition, and prediction.

## Activation Function:
    An activation function is a mathematical function in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that takes the sum of weighted inputs and applies a nonlinear transformation to produce an output signal, determining if and how strongly a neuron "fires" or "activates". Without activation functions, neural networks would only be able to learn linear relationships, similar to a simple linear regression model. By introducing non-linearity, activation functions enable neural networks to learn complex patterns and relationships in data, which is essential for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.
